/**
 * Created by hd on 2017/8/22.
 *
 * some vendors provide SDK maybe exists error in the usb module.
 *
 * the error come from the API [UsbDevice.getInterface] and belongs to the system SDK error,
 * might throw a error [NullPointerException] after when you traverse all usb and call it.
 *
 * this error need the vendors to modify the underlying code,
 * however,in fact, we can also go to avoid it by use API[UsbDevice.getInterfaceCount] to judge,
 * butï¼Œin order to avoid other unknown problems to modify the underlying code is the best way.
 *
 * in theory, you only need to check once,so ,advice used that in project debugging or test project.
